Sales Analytics Power BI Report
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project Description:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This Power BI report provides comprehensive analysis of the sales in a company.
I made this dashboard trying to help the stakeholders to make the right decisions relating to the sales.

How to Use:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Download the report file (Sales.pbix).

Open it using Power BI Desktop.

Explore the visualizations and charts to analyze sales data.

Interact with the charts to get the specific information you want.

you can also download the raw data if you want to show the data before processing from the data files ( Sales.xlsx)

Requirements:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Power BI Desktop to open the report file (can be downloaded for free from the Power BI website).

Steps i followed in this report :

step 1 : I loaded the data into Power Query editor to transform the data to improve the quality of it. These tranformations are the followings:

(1) splitting the columns by delimiter (Tap delimiter).

(2)Changing data types of some columns.

(3) Promoted headers ( use first row as header).

step 2 : apply these the transformations on the data and load the data

The dashboard I divided it into 5 pages and each page showing a specific information .
I added a page navigator in all pages to move between the Pages easily " by Click on the page in the navigator with clicking ctrl".

Note :
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are some informations i show in all pages except (Map) page. These informations are : total sales , total profits , num of orders , total quantity , max discount and min discount.
There also 2 slicers i used in my dashboard which you can use to specialize youe results .The fist slicer is (Returned or Not) slicer and the other one is ( Order date)
